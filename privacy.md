### For personal data, we will only be collecting the studentsâ€™ name and age (for the leader board), as well as them having a username so they can be linked to their teachers. The teachers will only have their name collected and associated with a username. This data will be protected by passwords set by the users and stored securely. This data will not be processed outside the app apart from for school purposes, so we will be compliant with GDPR.
### We are obeying the cookie law by having the participants (or their legal guardians where applicable) agree to terms and conditions including information on how their data is used when they create their account.
