## **Overview**

#### Client: Anna Sibley 

#### Organisation: Bristol Music School

This app will be designed to provide motivation for young students to practise every day by tracking their progress each time they do so.
The selection of pieces is in line with the Suzuki method.


## **Features**

### __Tasks__ 
On any given day, the student will have the following tasks to complete:
  * #### **Learn**
    The student needs to practise the piece they are currently learning.
    Initially, all pieces are marked as “Learning”.
    Once the student is done learning a piece, they can mark it as “Reviewing” to review it in the future.


  * #### **Review**
    The student reviews a piece they have finished learning.
    Through an engaging selection process, the student will select the piece to review. Once they are done playing the piece, their progress is updated.
  
  
  * #### **Listen**
    The student needs to listen to a recording of the required piece.


### __Progress tracking__ 
The tasks completed each day are recorded in the form of a chart. There will be an indicator for which tasks were completed on each day of the week. This will encourage the student to practise consistently.
