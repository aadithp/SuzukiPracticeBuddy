Q: Student progressing to the next piece - do we just trust them?
A: The teacher will tell them to progress and they will just click a button on the app

Started sending the review list for each piece

Potentially add a free choice/wildcard - could be any piece, not just from the book

She really liked the app as seen in the video - quite basic but good

Progress bar is a good idea, keep it up
And making it look better is good

*Can we remove the pieces from the wheel when they have been reviewed, then add all pieces back when the wheel is empty

Q: Any ideas for the design? Colours or anything?
A: Just make it fun!

Q: Do you want anything added to the listening section?
A: No license to use the pieces on the app, so they should just listen to it themselves then yes/no
