Wheel:
 - Tap to spin?
 - Or arrow showing how to spin

Improvements:
 - Store may be a bit difficult but lots of things we can add
	 - hats, shirts, shorts, shoes, things to hold, glasses, etc.
 - Character will probably just be a stick man
	 - Needs to be more exciting than just a man stood still in the centre
  	 - maybe swaying, or sometimes jumps or moves
 - Maybe make the main function buttons bigger

Joe has fixed the database, so it doesn't reset when you close the app

Things to work on:
 - Joe: try to implement a basic version of the store
 - Thomas: work on wheel page and improve the look
 - Aadith: work on the testing
 - Yuqing: notifications to remind students every day
 - Daniel: design stuff - change the UI to make it look like our basic designs
