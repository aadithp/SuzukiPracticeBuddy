Topic: Client Meeting 4
Date: 19/03/2021

- Set her up on Google so she can access the app
- Talking her through the version of the app
	- ideas we have planned to improve it
		- fixing the bugs with the wheel
	- how the badges work
	- almost finished - going to move on to the design
	- overall, it's great! looks like it will be really good fun.
- She is going to sign the contract for us

Her suggestions:
	- listening - when done, play a sound to reward them
	- if possible, let them choose a piece to start from when they sign in
		- maybe also allow them to skip forward
	- just to book 3, not book 4

We are working on:
	- appearance
	- achievements
	- store/currency for customisation, to make it more fun
