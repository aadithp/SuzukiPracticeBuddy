What we wrote (Portfolio A) is good, she really liked it

2 things to clarify:
 - Don't need to monitor how often they practice
 - Main idea is to help parents make practising old pieces fun (see video)
 - Just track their own process for themselves, so it doesn't get competitive
 - Individual chart with ticks/smiley faces to track their own progress
 
Main purpose is to make reviewing pieces fun!
The biggest part is the review section

*** basic structure of the student page ***
SUZUKI PRACTICE/REVIEW BUDDY:
Today's Tasks
    Current Piece
     - show's piece
     - practised? (yes/no)
    Review
     - Wheel of Fortune style, or picking from hat, something fun/engaging
     - linked to current piece they play
     - some sort of rewarding action/sound when they've done it
     - just one review each day
    Listening
     - have you listened to your recordings? (yes/no)
     
     
Teachers don't need to do anything with it!
Only student accounts... so students don't really need accounts as they don't need to link between each other/the teachers (as there are no teachers on the app)
