Today's Tasks
    Current Piece
     - show's piece
     - practised? (yes/no)
    Review
     - Wheel of Fortune style, or picking from hat, something fun/engaging
     - linked to current piece they play
     - some sort of rewarding action/sound when they've done it
     - just one review set each day
    Listening
     - have you listened to your recordings? (yes/no)
     
Current piece and listening come as pop-ups when you click on them, review opens a new page

Will have a log in page, but will need no credentials to get to main page
Wheel of Fortune could just be a button and randomiser for MVP

MENTOR COMMENTS:
 - we seem to be going along fine
 - passed on CircleCI and AWS problems to Simon
    - would recommend speaking to Dan over Simon
 - keep going with what we have got, don't worry too much for MVP, what we already have would probably be fine
