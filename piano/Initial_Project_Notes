- What is the purpose of the app?
      - Communication between parents and teachers?

  - Should it be an app or website?
      - What platform (Android/iOS)?
      - What language?

  - What inputs is the system supposed to take?
      - Teachers lesson notes?
      - Notes from parents/student from practice?

  - Do teachers input pieces/exercises done in lesson, then these are put into
    a random practice regime?
      - Should the teacher also input how many hours a week the student needs to
        practice?

  - Do parents need to make notes?
      - Will these be on each piece, or each practice session?

  - How will a new student be added to the app/their teacher?
      - Should they just create an account on the app?
      - Will the teacher then give them a code to register as their student? Or
        vice versa?

  - Are the revision pieces additional to the pieces set by the teacher?
      - Will the list of pieces be input by the teacher, or be built in to the app?
      - Will the teacher split the list into ability levels/will it already be
        split?
        
Other Ideas:
  - for the extra revision pieces, give them an initial ranking then students can
    rate the difficulty and the level will evolve
  - separate accounts for teachers and students, teachers can then make notes on
    their app for each lesson, which is linked to a specific student account
    
FLOW:
  1. student has lesson
  2. teacher makes notes on lesson
  3. practice regime developed
  4. student practices
  5. student/parent makes notes on practice
  6. extra work is given

  Alternatively, only steps 1-3 are executed
